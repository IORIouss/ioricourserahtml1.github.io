          <h2>Chicken</h2>
          In the barnyard, feathers fly,
A clucking chorus fills the sky.
And in the midst of all the noise,
Struts proud and regal, the chicken boys.

Their feathers shimmer in the sun,
As they scratch and peck and have some fun.
With beady eyes and pointed beak,
They strut about, so bold and chic.

Their wings may be too small to fly,
But they make up for it with their style.
And when it comes to laying eggs,
These feathered friends are the best.

So let us raise a toast to thee,
Oh chickens, with your cackling glee.
Your eggs are tasty, your feathers fine,
You are truly a bird divine.

          <h2>beef</h2>
          In the fields so green and wide,
The cattle graze as they abide.
Their coats so sleek, their eyes so kind,
A gentle heart in each bovine mind.

They chew their cud and moo with glee,
As they roam the pasture wild and free.
Their sturdy hooves and mighty frame,
Are a testament to nature's game.

And when it's time to bring them in,
Their lowing voices fill the din.
The rancher knows each one by name,
And treats them with loving care, not shame.

From the succulent grass they graze,
To the juicy steak on our plates,
The beef we savor is a gift,
From these gentle giants of the rift.

So let us give thanks to the cow,
For the nourishment we have now.
May we always treat them with respect,
And never forget the role they effect.

          <h2>sushi</h2>
          From the ocean's depths it comes,
A delicacy that leaves us stunned.
Sushi, the perfect harmony,
Of rice and fish, a symphony.

Wrapped in seaweed, or not at all,
Each piece is crafted with great wherewithal.
The chef's knife slices with precision,
A work of art, with each decision.

Salmon, tuna, eel and more,
Each flavor bursting, as we explore.
Wasabi and soy sauce on the side,
A perfect pairing, a flavor ride.

With chopsticks in hand, we savor each bite,
As we marvel at this culinary delight.
Sushi, a dish that's stood the test of time,
A gift from the sea, so sublime.

So let us give thanks to the fish,
For the taste that we cannot miss.
May we always treat the ocean with care,
So that sushi may always be there.
